# Chronetic v1.0 (Alpha)
: Java Time Pattern Analysis Library

## Overview

**Chronetic** is an open-source time pattern analysis library built to describe time-series data. Written in Java, using [Jenetics](http://jenetics.io/), an advanced genetic algorithm, Chronetic is able to locate the most prevalent patterns occuring in a given time-series dataset. Patterns are aggregated into a **Chronotype** and can be translated into a human-readable format with a **ChronoDescriptor**.

## Example

```java
ChronoSeries chronoSeries = ChronoSeries.of(
        Instant.parse("2011-11-04T08:48:11Z"),
        Instant.parse("2012-11-02T09:23:16Z"),
        Instant.parse("2013-11-01T09:51:49Z"),
        Instant.parse("2014-11-07T08:43:00Z"),
        Instant.parse("2015-11-06T08:22:25Z")
);

//static access, default engine
String description = Chronetic.defaultEngine()
        .analyze(chronoSeries).withHourPrecision()
        .describe().humanReadable();

//Once a year from 2011 to 2015 on the first Friday of November between 8AM - 10AM
System.out.println(description);


//custom engine
Chronetic chronetic = Chronetic.configure()
        .populationSize(500)
        .survivorsSize(250).offspringSize(250)
        .maxGeneration(15).build();

description = chronetic.analyze(chronoSeries)
        .withHourPrecision()
        .describe().humanReadable();

//Once a year from 2011 to 2015 on the first Friday of November between 8AM - 10AM
System.out.println(description);
```
